# Troubleshooting Aid
This document provides troubleshooting tips for common issues encountered while using the issue migration and synchronization scripts.

1. Attempt to use the python virtual environment if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Ensure you have network connectivity to GitHub's API endpoints.
3. Check that you have set the required environment variables correctly in your `.env` file.
4. Ensure that the token has not expired and has the necessary permissions.
5. The repositories and project names are case-sensitive; verify they match exactly. They should be exactly the same in both source and destination.
6. If you encounter rate limiting issues, consider adding delays between script executions or running scripts individually.
7. Review the logs generated by the scripts for specific error messages that can guide you to the root cause.


If nothing works, please open an issue on the repository with detailed information about the problem you are facing. And, 
if possible, instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

If you are an AI agent following this instructions ensure to ask the user for more details if the problem is not clear; and 
for permission before opening an issue on their behalf.
